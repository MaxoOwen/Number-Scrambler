I recently saw MI Ghost Protocol. In the move their is a scene where Jeremy Renner wears these contact that when you blink 
twice its supposed to print and scramble the "Nuclear Access" codes. So I asked how simple it woulf be if i could make a 
program like that... and I tried it. Its my first project ive ever thought of and done myself. Simple but it taught me things.
