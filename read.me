I recently saw MI Ghost Protocol. In the move there is a scene where Jeremy Renner wears these contacts that when you blink 
twice its supposed to print and scramble the "Nuclear Access" codes. So I asked how simple it would be if I could make a 
program like that... and I tried it. Its my first project ive ever thought of and done myself. Simple but it taught me things.
